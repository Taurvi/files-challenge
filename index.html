	<p id="char-desc">Alexei Volkoff (Russian: Алексей Волков) is the head of Volkoff Industries (Russian: Волков Промышленности), a front for an international arms smuggling ring.
 Volkoff was said to have been born in Moscow, Russia and is fluent in English, Russian, and German.
 Volkoff is currently wanted in the United States for several charges, including conspiracy to murder and to destroy property of the United States government.
 There is very little information about Volkoff and his operations.
 Attempts have been made to infiltrate his organization by several agencies, however agents either turn up dead or are currently missing.
