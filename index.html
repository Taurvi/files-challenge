	<p id="char-desc">Alexei Volkoff (Russian: Алексей Волков) is the head of Volkoff Industries (Russian: Волков Промышленности), a front for an international arms smuggling ring. Volkoff was born in Moscow, Russia and is fluent in Russian, English, and German. Volkoff has one daughter. There is no information on the identity of his wife, however it is presumed he is divorced. Volkoff has many connections, particularly with the Russian Mafia. Volkoff posesses a unique skillset which suggests former employment with the KGB. Volkoff may still be doing work for the KGB's successor, the SVR. Volkoff is currently wanted in the United States for several charges, including conspiracy to murder and to destroy property of the United States government. Attempts have been made to infiltrate his organization by several agencies, however agents either turn up dead or are currently missing.</p>
